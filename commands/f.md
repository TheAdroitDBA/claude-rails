description: Finalize current work. Turns off debug logging, updates the feature doc progress checklist, marks the feature COMPLETE, and reports git status.

Finalize the current feature. Work through these steps in order:

1. Turn off any debug logging, verbose flags, or temporary instrumentation added during development.

2. Update the feature doc ### Progress checklist: mark completed items with their commit hashes. Every decision point that happened during implementation should have a progress entry.

3. Mark the feature doc ## Status as COMPLETE.

4. Remove resolved bugs from the issues tracker (memory/KNOWN-ISSUES.md or the declared tracker). Only remove entries that are verifiably fixed by this work.

5. Run git status and report the current state of the working tree.
