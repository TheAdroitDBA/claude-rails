description: Finalize current work. Turns off debug logging, updates the feature doc progress checklist, marks the feature COMPLETE, and reports git status.

Finalize the current feature. Work through these steps in order:

1. Turn off any debug logging, verbose flags, or temporary instrumentation added during development.

2. Update the feature doc ### Progress checklist: mark completed items with their commit hashes. Every decision point that happened during implementation should have a progress entry.

3. Mark the feature doc ## Status as COMPLETE.

4. Move resolved bugs from **Active** to **Resolved** in the issues tracker (memory/KNOWN-ISSUES.md or the declared tracker). Append ` | resolved: <today's date>` to each entry. Only move entries that are verifiably fixed by this work. Do NOT delete entries.

5. If the **Resolved** section has more than 10 entries, move the oldest resolved entries to `memory/KNOWN-ISSUES-ARCHIVE.md` (create the archive file if it does not exist).

6. Quick tracker hygiene (while the tracker is open): scan **Active** entries. Flag any that are older than 30 days or whose linked `[BUG]` criterion no longer exists in the feature doc. Report findings inline -- do not block finalization.

7. Run git status and report the current state of the working tree.
